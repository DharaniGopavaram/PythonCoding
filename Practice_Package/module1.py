"""
The below module is written in a package called Practice_Package
Before Python3.3 a folder can be treated as a Python package if it contains __init__.py file.
Since Python 3.3 we don't need to have __init__.py inside a folder to be considered as a package
Packages are nothing but a group of related modules.
Packages can contain sub-packages in them as well.
Packages help to resolve naming conflicts
